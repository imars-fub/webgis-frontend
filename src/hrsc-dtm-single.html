<h4>Single-orbit digital terrain models derived from stereo image strips of the High-Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) of ESA's Mars Express</h4>
<p>Product type: single-orbit DTMs (Level-4)</p>
<p>Grid resolution: 50 m per pixel<p>
<p>Object points derived from single orbits after bundle adjustment.</p>
<p>Note: this dataset has been compiled from the available level 4 single strip DTMs. The individual strips are not adjusted to each other and therefore seams are visible between the strips.</p>
<p>Data source: - currently not available for public download.</p>
